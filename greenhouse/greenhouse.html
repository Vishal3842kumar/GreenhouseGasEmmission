        <h1>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h1>
        <p>Understanding the Causes, Effects, and Solutions</p>
    </header>

    <section id="introduction"><img src="greenhouse5.jpg" id="image">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Greenhouse gas, any gas that has the property of absorbing infrared radiation (net heat energy) emitted from Earth’s surface and reradiating it back to Earth’s surface, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect. Carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapour are the most important greenhouse gases. (To a lesser extent, surface-level ozone, nitrous oxides, and fluorinated gases also trap infrared radiation.) Greenhouse gases have a profound effect on the energy budget of the Earth system despite making up only a fraction of all atmospheric gases. Concentrations of greenhouse gases have varied substantially during Earth’s history, and these variations have driven substantial climate changes at a wide range of timescales. In general, greenhouse gas concentrations have been particularly high during warm periods and low during cold periods.</p>
    <br>
	<p>During the day, the sun shines through the atmosphere, warming the earth's surface cools, releasing heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That's what keeps the earth's temperature at an average 14&degC (57&degF).</p></section>

    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Industry and Manufacturing</h3>
			<p>Manufacturing and industry produce emissions, mostly from burning fossil fuels to produce energy for making things like cement, iron, steel, electronics, plastics, clothes, and other goods. Mining and other industrial processes also release gases, as does the construction industry.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Transportation</h3>
			<p>Burning fossil fuels like gasoline and diesel releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Agriculture</h3><img src="greenhouse4.jpg" id="image">
			<p>Agriculture contributes to greenhouse gas increases through land use in four main ways:<br> CO<sub>2</sub> releases linked to deforestation.<br> Methane releases from rice cultivation.<br> Methane releases from enteric fermentation in cattle.<br>Nitrous oxide releases from fertilizer application.</p></li>
        
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="effects">
        <h2>Effects of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Rising global temperatures</h3>
			<p>Greenhouse gases act similarly to the glass in a greenhouse: they absorb the sun's heat that radiates from the Earth's surface, trap it in the atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space. The greenhouse effect keeps the Earth's temperature warmer than it would otherwise be, supporting life on Earth.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Sea level rise</h3>
			<p>As greenhouse gases trap more energy from the sun, the oceans are absorbing more heat, resulting in an increase in sea surface temperatures and rising sea level.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Extreme weather events</h3>
			<p>Earth's lower atmosphere is becoming warmer and moister as a result of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. This gives the potential for more energy for storms and certain extreme weather events.</p></li>
       
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="solutions">
        <h2>Solutions to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Renewable energy sources</h3>
			<p>Renewable energy sources – which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth – are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Energy efficiency</h3>
			<p>Energy efficiency delivers a number of environmental benefits. It notably reduces Greenhouse Gas Emissions, both direct emissions from fossil fuel combustion or consumption, and indirect emissions reductions from electricity generation.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Sustainable agriculture practices</h3>
			<p>This system eliminates synthetic nitrogen fertilizers and thus could lower global agricultural Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Organic farming could result in a higher soil organic carbon content compared to non-organic systems.</p></li>
